| Public routes
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The canonical route contract is docs/product/information-architecture.md §1.
| Routes are added as their feature specs are implemented; see
| docs/planning/sprint-plan.md §2.4 for which sprint owns which spec.
|
| The four MVP entry points (mvp-scope.md §1) — current status:
|   /pemesanan-makam   Sprint 4  public-booking-wizard              STUB (S4-T3): honest
|                                "coming soon" page, not gated — real wizard is S4-T4
|   /marketplace       Sprint 4  funeral-marketplace-and-vendor-portal STUB (S4-T3): same,
|                                real marketplace is later in Sprint 4 (S4-T8)
|   /perpanjangan      Sprint 4  renewal-and-grave-registry          STUB (S4-T3): same,
|                                real renewal flow is later in Sprint 4 (S4-T7)
|   /faq               Sprint 4  public-faq                          implemented (S4-T2)
|   /                  Sprint 4  public-home-and-navigation          implemented (S4-T3,
|                                this batch) — homepage now serves real content; see
|                                App\Livewire\Public\HomePage's own doc block.
|
| Laravel's default welcome page was deliberately removed: it hardcodes colours
| and Tailwind arbitrary values, which the ci/verify-docs.sh token gates reject.
| `/` now serves the real HomePage component — AGENTS.md's four-fixed-order-
| services requirement is what HomePage + <x-mk.header> together implement,
| not a placeholder.
|
| The three STUB routes above return a real Livewire full-page component
| rendering an honest "coming soon" state (200 OK, header + footer intact),
| never Laravel's default 404 — requirements.md AC6 read expansively; see
| resources/views/livewire/public/coming-soon.blade.php's own doc block for
| why this is deliberately NOT <x-mk.gate-closed-page> (that component's
| copy assumes a real closed FEATURE GATE, which does not apply here — these
| three routes are simply not built yet this sprint). Each stub route is
| expected to be REPLACED wholesale by its owning spec's real routes, not
| extended in place.

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| FAQ — public-faq spec (design.md's Routes section)
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Read-only. Both FaqIndex routes and FaqArticleDetail resolve their data
| exclusively through App\Domain\Faq\FaqPublicQuery / FaqArticle::published()
| — see those classes' own doc blocks for the AC6 guarantee. `/faq/kategori/
| {categorySlug}` (3 segments) and `/faq/{articleSlug}` (2 segments) never
| collide regardless of registration order, since Laravel routes match on
| segment count/shape, not first-match-wins ambiguity here — the more
| specific route is still registered first for readability.

| Legal — privacy policy and terms of service
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Closes a real, previously-documented gap: layouts/app.blade.php's footer
| has linked to /privasi and /syarat-ketentuan since the homepage footer
| was upgraded (26 Jul 2026), but neither route existed, so both links
| 404d — see that file's own (now-updated) doc comment. Read-only, no
| App\Domain\** dependency, same shape as the FAQ routes above.
|
| The body copy these two routes serve is placeholder/draft legal content,
| explicitly labelled as such on both pages — see App\Livewire\Public\
| Legal\PrivacyPolicy's own doc block for why (sprint-plan.md §10: "legal/
| privacy decisions (G7)" are "Not delegable to an agent at all").

| Bantuan — PUB-060, the customer-service escape hatch
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Closes a real defect found 8 Aug 2026, the same class as the /privasi and
| /syarat-ketentuan gap closed on 26 Jul 2026 — a link shipped ahead of its
| destination, except this one shipped on EVERY page.
|
| <x-mk.header> renders a persistent "Bantuan" action on both the mobile and
| desktop bars (information-architecture.md §2 makes it mandatory and
| forbids collapsing it into the hamburger), and seven further views link
| /bantuan: layouts/app.blade.php's footer, both FAQ views, both legal
| views, the coming-soon stub, and the homepage. No route backed it, so the
| one affordance design-system.md §6.10 requires on every transactional
| screen 404d from every screen — and product-brief.md §5 point 10 ("Semua
| halaman memiliki customer-service escape hatch") was unmet site-wide.
|
| Deliberately static: no domain read, no form. This is where §6.5's
| provider-unavailable copy and the FAQ's empty state send a stuck user, so
| it must still render when the database is down. See App\Livewire\Public\
| Support\HelpCentre's own doc block for the full reasoning, including why
| no contact form exists and why no wa.me deep link is minted.
